# Dotfiles

You've seen 'em before: this is my set of dotfiles. Currently, I've got customizations for zsh, vim, and git. You probably won't find anything too incredible here. There are better ones to use, but if you want to use this one, here are a few pointer:

- DON'T use this gitconfig file as it is now. You'll want to open it up and replace my name and email address with your own. Otherwise, I'll get all the credit for your work.

- You can alias all the appropriate files in one fell swoop by running `install.sh` However, it expects you to clone this `dotfiles` repository into `~/bin/dotfiles`. If you're putting it somewhere else, you'll have to change those paths in `install.sh` and in `zsh/zshrc`.

That is all.
