# file-types package

Specify additional file types for languages.

For example, you can associate `.ex_em_el` with `text.xml` in your `config.cson` as follows:

```cson
'file-types':
  'ex_em_el': 'text.xml'
```

# Caveats

You probably don't want to assign the same file type to multiple languages...
