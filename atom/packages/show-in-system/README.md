## [atom.io](http://atom.io) package to show and open files or directories in the system file manager

A small extension which adds two new entries
to the file-view context-menu and
to the context-menu of the tab-view.

The first one will open the system file manager and will mark
the selected file while the second option will open the file
with the default system application.
